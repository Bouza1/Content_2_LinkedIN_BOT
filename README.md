# Content_2_LinkedIN_BOT
Content Scrapper + LinkedIN bot.

A Kivy based app which scrapes Reddit and returns the top "Technology" news articles in any given time frame (Now, Day, Week, Month, Year or All-Time). The app allows
the user to cycle through each article title with the option to open said article for further reading, post the given article directly to Linked-In as well as given an
input field allowing the user to write a custom title for the Linked-In Post.

To USE:
If this is your first time using the app please alter the username and password variables in the main.py file to show your Linked-In username and password.
Then simply press run. After utilising the app for the first time, cookies will be stored to enable instant login.

Future Developments:
Front-End needs re-designing.
